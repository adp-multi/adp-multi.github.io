## What is adp-multi?

adp-multi is an adaptation of the [Algebraic Dynamic Programming](http://bibiserv.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/adp/)
method for [multiple context-free grammars](mcfg).

It is based on the original [Haskell implementation](https://bitbucket.org/gsauthof/adpcombinators)
and can be considered an unoptimized prototype.

## How can I learn more about it?

If you are new to ADP, then it's best to go through the 
[online course](http://bibiserv.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/cgi-bin/dpcourse) of the Bielefeld University
and/or read a [tutorial-style paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scico.2003.12.005) from its inventors.

If you don't know multiple context-free grammars yet, then you should first read the 
[explanation](mcfg) for it.

After that, you can either look at some [examples](how_to_use) or check out the source code and start
hacking.
