## What is adp-multi?

adp-multi is an adaptation of the [Algebraic Dynamic Programming](http://bibiserv.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/adp/)
method for [multiple context-free grammars](mcfg).

It is a library based on the original [Haskell implementation](https://bitbucket.org/gsauthof/adpcombinators)
and can be considered an unoptimized prototype.

## Where do I start?

If you are new to ADP, then it's best to go through the 
[online course](http://bibiserv.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/cgi-bin/dpcourse) of the Bielefeld University
and/or read a [tutorial-style paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scico.2003.12.005) from its inventors.

If you don't know multiple context-free grammars yet, then you should first read the 
[explanation](mcfg) for it.

After that, you should go to the [quick start guide](/quick_start) where you learn
what's different compared to original Haskell-ADP and how to write your own grammars.

There's also a short motivational/introductional talk called 
"[Predicting Pseudoknots Without Hacking in C]({{urls.media}}/talk_herbstseminar2012.pdf)"
that I gave at the "10. Herbstseminar der Bioinformatik" (2012) which summarizes why adp-multi is useful
and in which direction future work might go.
